> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

    The software I tested was GitLab. I have not used GitLab previously, so it took some time to learn to navigate the page and find the correct things. I was not familiar with any type of hands-on software testing before this task. However, I found doing this project enjoyable, even if I was frustrated at first. It took a few tries to get it right and I needed to watch a few YouTube videos to summarize some course topics and refresh my memory from earlier course concepts. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

    I followed the test example on 02_LoginPage.txt. I reviewed what was asked on the task template, and proceeded to complete them one by one starting with positive test cases first. I reviewed some of the basic requirements and functionality of the GitLab application. I tried to include all relevant steps in my test cases so they could be easily followed and repeated. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 

    This was my first testing project, so I do not have any other tools to recommend. So far I have only been reading theory on software testing. 


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

    I used Visual Code and also the MacBook TeXturi for my file and text editing. 

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

    At first I was a little frustrated with this project because I do not have much hands on experience with Visual Studio or Github. Gitlab is completely new to me. So I had to learn to manage these software, instead of being able to fully focus on completing the assignment. I think the frustration was also due to me having issues managing my time this time of the year, when there are so many overlapping course assignment deadlines. I initially addressed this by sending a first draft of the assignment which was only half done. Then the deadline for the assignment got extended, so I was able to move other tasks from this week around, and spend the current weekend on working on this project. Now I have finished all the parts of this assignment and feel more confident in my skills because I was not in such a rush. 


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

    I have used GitHub before in two other courses earlier this year, so I was not really comfortable with even the basic Github tasks like pushing and pulling code. I did have some trouble. I am also using a Macbook, and I find Macbooks often have issues with Git and Github. 
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

    I would consider the robot framework because it seems to be really universally used. It is also fairly easy to understand even as a person who does not have much if any proper coding experience. 


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

    A LinkedIn and Glassdoor search highlights programming knowledge especially of languages such as Python and Java. Naturally automation framework, tool, and technology experitise is expected. Experience with CI/CD pipelines, DevOps practices, and version control systems are also required in many job ads for automation testers. Problem-solving skills and decision-making skills are mentioned, such as good communication skills and the desire to effectively produce good quality results. Ads on both sites also seem to often require a degree in relevant fields such as a Bachelor's or Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science or Engineering. So it may not be enough if one is competent in the skills asked, they may end up hiring someone with a relevant (or maybe higher) degree. Of course experience also matters, and often practical experience wins over a degree. 


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

    When it comes to the technical skills, I definitely need a stronger foundation in programming. I mainly know some basic HTML and CSS, which is not much in todays world when many are very competent coders. I think at least learning Python and maybe JavaScript would be needed for me. Being a more skilled coder would benefit me no matter what career I pursue. For software testing career, I would need to work more on actual hands on software testing projects during my studies, so I have something to show for my skills when I graduate. All experience is valuable. I would also need to get more familiar with automation tools and performance tools, learn more version control, familiarize myself with CI/CD pipelines, and get actual project work experience on DevOps practices. I may also need to get my degree and graduate because I feel like many companies do not want to hire students. When it comes to the so-called soft skills I think I am doing quite fine - I am a fairly good problem solver. I am currently working on a Master's degree and another degree in engineering, which definitely have equipped me with soft skills many employers appreciate. I am analytical, persistent, good researcher, and I am able to communicate effectively while being mindful of the context.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

    I think this assignment was an excellent way to put the course theory into practice. I learned how to draft and execute detailed test cases, manage variables, and validate outcomes effectively. Many if not most UAS and university courses only focus on the theory, which then makes it hard for us students to have anything concrete to show for our skills. Of course course grades do reflect ones knowledge on the topic, but when companies look for interns or employees they do not want to teach how to use software or other basic thing - they expect these things are already taught in university. The problem is that meanwhile the concepts and basics are taught during our studies, we, the students, lack the hands-on practice on the topics. It is very different to describe a certain protocol or process than to actually complete it manually by oneself. I think most courses lack real-life examples of the topics the courses teach, so it was really nice this course had a project like this. 

    Having said that, I also think that it would have been nice to have more guidance sessions on the project during the course, maybe some kind of practice assignments before the final task. The practice assignments could be optional to complete, as in not required to pass the course. I think many students who took the course were not prepared for how much time the final project would take, because many of us have no experience on these matters and therefore find it hard to estimate the amount of time and work it will take to complete all the tasks successfully - I know because this happened to me. I feel I was really unprepared to do such assignment, especially because this time of year we have exams and so many course project assignments are due, that it is hard to focus on something completely new meanwhile trying to learn how to navigate new applications. I am really thankful that the project due date was extended by a few days. I had time to properly orient myself in the project because I had learned it is not a quick task, I was able to go through earlier course topics and concepts, watch a few videos, and then complete the project again with better success than the first time. 

    Overall, I found the content of the course and the final assignment comprehensive and helpful for building a basic foundation in software testing.

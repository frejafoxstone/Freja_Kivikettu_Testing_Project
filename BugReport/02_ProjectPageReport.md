
## Summary (Summarize the bug encountered concisely)
There is a typo in the code for the "Create blank project" text on the GitLab project creation page. Instead of the word "blank", there is "black" (Create black project) on the create a new project page in GitLab. This will be confusing for users. 

## Steps to reproduce     
Open browser and navigate to GitLab. Log in a valid user. Select New project. See the button that says "Create black project" instead of "Create blank project". Notice the typo = instead of blank = black.

## What is the current bug behavior?
It is a typo where the create a project button reads "Create black project" instead of "Create blank project". 

## What is the expected correct behavior?
The create a project button should read "Create blank project" instead of "Create black project".
